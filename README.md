# Threats
**Metrics for quantifying the contributions of different threats to Red Lists**

## Purpose
Improved quantification and reporting of threats affecting red-listed species or ecosystems, using the Red List Index or the Expected Loss of Species. Data from one or more Red Lists are needed as input.

## Contents
The repository contains the **R** code to reproduce the findings of Sandvik & Pedersen (2023) as well as generic functions that can be used to analyse threats in other Red Lists:

* The _functions_ used are defined in [function.R](function.R).
* The specific analyses of the Norwegian Red Lists of _species_ are shown in [species.md](species.md) (with the underlying R Markdown file [available here](species.Rmd)).
* The specific analyses of the Norwegian Red List of _ecosystems_ are shown in [ecosyst.md](ecosyst.md) (with the underlying R Markdown file [available here](ecosyst.Rmd)).
* The changes from version 1.0 to 1.1. are explained in [scopesev.md](scopesev.md) (with the underlying R Markdown file [available here](scopesev.Rmd)).
