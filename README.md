# Threats
Quantifying the contributions of threats to Red Lists using the Red List Index or the Expected Loss of Species

## Purpose
Improved quantification and reporting of threats affecting red-listed species or ecosystems. Data from one or more Red Lists are needed as input.

## Related resources
The code described here

* is archived on _Zenodo_ at [doi:10.5281/zenodo.7843806](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7843806);
* is used and explained in an article in _Conservation Biology_ by [Sandvik & Pedersen (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14105);
* uses data available from the _Dryad Digital Repository_ at [doi:10.5061/dryad.gmsbcc2sd](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gmsbcc2sd).

## Contents
The repository contains the **R** code to reproduce the findings of Sandvik & Pedersen (2023) as well as generic functions that can be used to analyse threats in other Red Lists:

* The _functions_ used are defined in [function.R](function.R).
* The specific analyses of the Norwegian Red Lists of _species_ are shown in [species.md](species.md) (with the underlying R Markdown file [available here](species.Rmd)).
* The specific analyses of the Norwegian Red List of _ecosystems_ are shown in [ecosyst.md](ecosyst.md) (with the underlying R Markdown file [available here](ecosyst.Rmd)).
