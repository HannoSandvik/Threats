¤¤¤ Give a brief summary of dataset contents, contextualized in experimental procedures and results.


## Description of the data and file structure

The dataset contains six files:
(1) Species.xlsx (microsoft excel spreadsheet workbook with Red Lists for species)
(2) species.csv (semicolon-delimited plain-text file with Red Lists for species)
(3) Species.pdf (explanations of species.csv)
(4) Ecosyst.xlsx (microsoft excel spreadsheet workbook with the Red List for ecosystems)
(5) ecosyst.csv (semicolon-delimited plain-text file with the Red List for ecosystems)
(6) Ecosyst.pdf (explanations of ecosyst.csv)

The excel workbooks contain the same information as the respective csv and the pdf files combined.

Columns, abbreviations etc. are explained in the excel and pdf files.
